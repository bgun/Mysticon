Draw the Misty Mountains down the middle of your map. Want a dragon to show up, breathing fire and speaking in riddles? Name him Smaug and start writing. So, with such freedom available, why do some authors opt for the constraints of the here and now? What are the advantages--and pitfalls--of writing the fantastic into our own backyards?",
